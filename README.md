# GeoSniffer

GeoSniffer is a web app that provides basic information about countries, such as language, capital, population, and more. This repository contains both the frontend and backend code for the app.

## Live Demo

There is a live demo at the following url: `https://geosniffer.netlify.app/`

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes bundled with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Lyvel/GeoSniffer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd GeoSniffer
```

3. Install the dependencies for both frontend and backend:

```
cd frontend
npm install
cd ../backend
npm install
```

## Running the App

1. Start the backend server by running the following command in the `backend` folder:

```
npm run dev
```

Keep the backend server running in its terminal.

2. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` folder, then start the frontend development server:

```
cd path/to/GeoSniffer/frontend
npm start
```

This should automatically open your default web browser and load the GeoSniffer app at `http://localhost:3000`. If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can manually visit the URL.

That's it! You should now be able to use the GeoSniffer app in your browser. Enjoy exploring countries and discovering new information.
